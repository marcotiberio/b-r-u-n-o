bruno is the pseudonym of Andrea Codolo and Giacomo Covacich since 2013. The project, which is based in Venice, combines a graphic design studio, an exhibition space and a specialist bookstore focussing on visual communication and
          international independent publishers. As for communication design, the studio deals in particular with visual identities, setting up exhibitions, publishing projects, information design and data visualisation in collaboration with
          institutions, cultural foundations and private clients. Since 2014 bruno has also become a publishing brand, dedicated to designing and publishing limited editions with printing techniques other than industrial production.
